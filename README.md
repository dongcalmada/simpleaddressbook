# simpleaddressbook
Address Book (with Basic CRUD)

Maintained for my PHP-MySQL Class

Remember:

1. The application uses just one table for CRUD.
2. Copy the config.example.php to .config.php. Then supply all the required data.
3. Edit the main_table_def.php to map the database table to the application.
4. Edit the style.css to customize the appearance of your application.
